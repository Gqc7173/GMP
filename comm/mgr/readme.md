# Device Manager

This is a key part of the GMP library. This module provided a easy magagement way for users.
Just like what the device manager do in Windows OS, this module collection all the pheripheral information 
and all the outer hardware information, and manage them automatically, meanwhile provided a easiest way to 
implement RPC(remote process call).

We strongly recommend that user may use the tool, `dev_mgr`. And if you need to use the RPC functionality provided in this library,
you have no choice to use this class.
